# DFS Football AI Agent

## Overview
The DFS Football AI Agent allows users to ask **natural language questions** about fantasy football data and get **PostgreSQL query results** instantly.  

It connects to a database containing DFS player stats, projections, and schedules, generates SQL queries using Google Gemini AI, and displays the results in a clean Streamlit interface.

> Note: The scraping/ETL pipeline is separate â€” this agent only reads data from the database.
